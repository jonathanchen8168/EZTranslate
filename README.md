How does it work?
After finishing installing EZtranslate! onto your computer, an icon with the EZtranslate! logo should appear on the top righthand side of your Chrome browser. After selecting text you can either rightclick and select EZtranslate! in the context menu or you can click the EZtranslate! icon to search for the translation of the word. After clicking either the menu item or the icon a new popup window will be created with the selected text searched through jisho.org's dictionary search engine. Jisho.org handles its searches with either english text or Japanese text and will return the translation of what was selected. Because jisho.org is an external 3rd party website, the purpose of this extension is to cut out the middle step of needing to navigate to the website in a new window to search for the word that you may not know.

What is shown in jisho.org? -website that is used to search for translation
After searching for a word, it will give you the translation of the word and other possible meanings of the word. There will also be a link to play the audio of how the word is pronounced as well as a list of other possible meanings for the word. By clicking the more details link in the bottom righthand corner of the word panel, it will bring you to another page which gives further detail to the word. Directly underneath the word there is also relevant information of how common the word is and what level in the Japanese Language Proficiency Test the word would appear in.
